Testing the Knex exports and database
> after creating and updatin all of this, we were able to test a file.
We created a new file, index.js and placed it outside the folders in the main folder.
We then entered these at the top: 

var development = require('./knexfile').development
var knex = require ('knex')(development)

We then entered our code for CRUD operations.
After this was done.

we ran 

node index.js

> and this launch the file and returned the results in the console.
> and used the https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/ [sqlite manager]
